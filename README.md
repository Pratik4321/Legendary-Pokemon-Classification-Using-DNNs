# Legendary Pokémon Classification Using DNN

This project classifies Pokémon as Legendary or non-Legendary using machine learning and deep learning models. I compare classical algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest with neural networks, including a ResNet-style deep neural network built in PyTorch.

## 🔍 Overview

- Task: Binary classification (Legendary or not)
- Dataset: [Pokémon with stats – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon)
- Frameworks: PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Shallow Neural Network
- Deep Feedforward Neural Network
- Residual DNN (ResNet-style)

## 📊 Key Features

- Data preprocessing with scaling and encoding
- Class imbalance handling
- Training/Validation/Test evaluation
- Loss & accuracy curve visualization
- Final model comparison



## ✅ Result Summary

Residual DNN achieved the best performance with 93% test accuracy, outperforming all classical models in precision, recall, and F1-score.
